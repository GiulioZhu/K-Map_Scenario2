# K-Map_Scenario2 #

## Instruction for running the code ##
### Using an IDE ###
1. **Open the directory in VSCode**, there seems to be a problem running the file on ItelliJ IDEA.
2. run the file "Main.java" either by typing the codes "javac Main.java" followed by "java Main.java" in the terminal or by clicking the green arrow on the top right corner of the screen.

### Using the terminal ###
1. Locate this directory in the terminal
2. Compile the file with "javac Main.java", this creates ".class" files
3. Run the file with "java Main.java"

## Structure of the directory ##
- UI.java (contains all the UI for the program)
- Main.java (contains the main function and runs the entire program)
- KMap.java (contains the kmap algorithm for the program) - **DO NOT MODIFY**
- Question.java (contains the Question class, used mainly to read information from the path "./questions/questions.csv")
    - can read and write to the file
- question.csv (contains the questions and answers for exercise part the program) - **DO NOT MODIFY**

## Note ##
- You can ignore the ".class" files, but **do not delete them**. (They are the compiled files for the java files)
    - otherwise you will have to compile the files again (see [Instruction for running the code](#instruction-for-running-the-code))
